How Stats Work (Since Leah was curious one time, and may need to explain some of this to people)
=================================================================================================

Any time someone views an item/thesis page, or downloads a file attached to an item, _after the page has been successfully rendered (to avoid counting "visits" that end up erroring out and leaving the user looking at a 500 page)_, the incoming request is first evaluated to determine whether or not it is being made by a bot. We believe that doing bot filtering at request time is more effective and allows us to base our decisions on a broader range of information than would normally be available via analyzing log files after the fact. We use the Voight-Kampff gem (https://github.com/biola/Voight-Kampff) to assist with bot recognition, which itself is based on a curated list of fingerprints of bots, robots, spiders, crawlers, and scrappers maintained here: https://github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents. This list is constantly evolving, and we (Peter, really) have been contributing back to it ourselves based on information from ERA's logs (https://github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents/commits?author=pbinkley). Perfect Bot Matching has not yet been invented.

If a request appears to be coming from a bot, no statistics related to the visit are recorded. Otherwise, views and downloads are recorded separately in the following manner:

* Using a data structure in Redis known as an HyperLogLog (http://antirez.com/news/75), if the IP address of the visitor is not already recorded for a view or download, the IP address of the visitor performing the request is recorded. Every item & thesis has two associated HLLs -- one tracking viewing IP addresses, the other tracking downloading IP addresses. These data structures allow us to quickly determine whether or not we have already seen the visiting address.

* If the IP address was not in the HLL prior to this request, an atomic increment (non-jargony: "atomic" meaning that no matter how many visits are downloads are happening simultaneously, the updates always happen in an indivisible, defined order that ensures the math work out correctly and no increments get lost or doubled) is performed on the associated counter in Redis. Again, each Item & Thesis has two associated counters -- one counting the number of views, the other counting the number of downloads.

The IP addresses in the HLLs are reset at the top of every hour. The counters are never reset. In this way, a visit or download can be recorded from each non-bot visitor once per hour. Since visits and downloads are tracked separately, a single visitor can have a visit AND a download counted within the same hour.

The statistics displayed on the Item and Thesis view page are fetched directly from Redis. Because statistics are recorded only AFTER a page has rendered successfully, when you view a page for the first time in a given hour, you are seeing the count *prior to* your visit being counted. Refreshing the page will cause the count to be updated to show you the count _including_ your visit before refreshing -- the system is not counting you a second time in that hour.
